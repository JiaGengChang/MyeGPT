Table name: `gep_scores`
Description: Risk scores derived from Gene expression profiling (GEP) signatures, which is the weighted mean of a number of genes or affymetrix probes - can usually be inferred by the number in the metric's name.
Format: column_number | field_name | description
# Identifier column
1|public_id|Patient public identifier. Last 4 digits are unique. e.g. MMRF_1021
# Risk index columns. GEP Signatures are scalar values positively associated with risk of progression and death. Each signature is derived from expression values of different sets of genes.
2|uams70|The UAMS 70-gene signature, from University of Arkansas Medical School (UAMS) study. e.g. 0.2810650052391087
3|emc92|The EMC92 or SKY92 gene signature, from Skyline Diagnostics. This is the gold-standard GEP risk score. e.g. 0.2709872633972444
4|ifm15|The IFM-15 gene signature e.g., 1.5037053920943737
5|mrc_ix_6|THE MRC IX-6 gene signature e.g., 0.0686400763053471
