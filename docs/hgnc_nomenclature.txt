Table name: `hgnc_nomenclature`
Description: Gene Nomenclature from HGNC, for the complete set of human genome genes from chromosomes  through 22, X, and Y. Also has metadata for genes like their canonical name/gene symbol and description.
Format: column_number|field_name|description
# Identifier columns
1|gene_symbol|Index column. HGNC-approved symbol of the gene. string. example: TRIM60P3Y
2|alias_symbol|One possible alias for the gene. NaN if it does not have an alias. e.g. "ACF" is an alias for gene "A1CF", "ADAR1" is an alias for "ADAR"
3|gene_stable_id|Index column. GENCODE accession/ENSEMBL Stable ID of the gene. string. example: ENSG00000227830.
# Gene description columns
4|gene_name|Description of the full name of the gene e.g. "alpha-1-B glycoprotein" for the gene "A1BG"
5|alias_name|One possible alias name for the gene. e.g. "iGb3 synthase" is an alias name for "alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2"
6|hgnc id|HGNC accession of the format HGNC:[digits] e.g. HGNC:37133
