Table name: `canonical_ig`
Description: Calls for canonical translocation events involving Immunoglobulin gene super-enhancer and the gene of interest. Events are detected by long insert, low-coverage whole genome sequencing.
Below is a description of each field. If description is empty, do not use the column unless explicitly instructed to.
Format:column_number|field_name|description
# Identifier column
1|public_id|Patient public identifier. Last 4 digits are unique. e.g. MMRF_1234
# Calls for various canonical translocations. Codes: 0 = negative, 1 = positive.
2|seqwgs_whsc1_call|WHSC1 translocation, also known as the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) subtype
3|seqwgs_ccnd3_call|CCND3 translocation, also known as t(6;14)(p21;q32) subtype
4|seqwgs_myc_call|MYC translocation, also known as the t(8;14)
5|seqwgs_mafa_call|MAFA translocation, the MAF-A gene, also known as t(8;14)
6|seqwgs_ccnd1_call|CCND1 translocation, cyclin D1 gene, also known as t(11;14)
7|seqwgs_ccnd2_call|translocation of CCND2, cyclin D2 gene, located on the 12p13.32 band
8|seqwgs_maf_call|MAF translocation or t(14;16)(q32;q23), which affects the MAF gene also referred to as c-MAF
9|seqwgs_mafb_call|MAF-B translocation which leads to MAF-B overexpression. The most common event is t(14;20)(q32;q23)
