Table name: `gatk_baf`
Description: B-allele frequencies of exome segments from whole exome sequencing of bone marrow plasma cell samples. Values range from 0 (homozygous) to 0.5 (fully heterozygous). To estimate the BAF of a certain gene, the copy number of the probe with largest overlap with that gene can be used, providing there are probes with sufficient overlap with the gene (>50% of the gene's length). BAF of <0.25 can be assumed to be loss of heterozygosity (LoH).
Format: column_number|field_name|description
1|sample|Patient sample identifier. Follows the format [PUBLIC_ID]_[VISIT_ID]_[BM=Bone Marrow/PB=Peripheral Blood]_CD138pos e.g. MMRF_1234_1_BM_CD138pos. PUBLIC_ID is MMRF_ followed by 4 random digits.
2|chromosome|chromosome name with the 'chr' in front. e.g. chr1, chr22, chrY
3|start|Genomic coordinates of the start of where the probe maps to. example 826107	
4|end|Genomic coordinates of the end of where the probe maps to. example 9608793
5|num_probes|The number of probes which map to this genomic segment. example 137
6|segment_mean|The mean log ratio of the probe intensity of this segment. example 0.48990600000000006
7|public_id|Patient public identifier. Last 4 digits are unique. e.g. MMRF_1234
8|visit|The visit ID of the patient. An integer. e.g. 1 means first visit
