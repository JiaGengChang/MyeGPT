Table Name: `gatk_baf`
Description: B-allele frequencies of exome segments from whole exome sequencing of bone marrow plasma cell samples. Values range from 0 (homozygous) to 0.5 (fully heterozygous). To estimate the BAF of a certain gene, the copy number of the probe with largest overlap with that gene can be used, providing there are probes with sufficient overlap with the gene (>50% of the gene's length). BAF of <0.25 can be assumed to be loss of heterozygosity (LoH).
column_number | name | description
1	SAMPLE	Patient sample identifier. Follows the format [PUBLIC_ID]_[VISIT_ID]_[BM=Bone Marrow/PB=Peripheral Blood]_CD138pos e.g. MMRF_1234_1_BM_CD138pos. PUBLIC_ID is MMRF_ followed by 4 random digits.
2   Chromosome  chromosome name with the 'chr' in front. e.g. chr1, chr22, chrY
3   Start	Genomic coordinates of the start of where the probe maps to. example 826107	
4   End	    Genomic coordinates of the end of where the probe maps to. example 9608793
5   Num_Probes	   The number of probes which map to this genomic segment. example 137
6   Segment_Mean    The mean log ratio of the probe intensity of this segment. example 0.48990600000000006
7   PUBLIC_ID   Patient public identifier. Last 4 digits are unique. e.g. MMRF_1234
8   VISIT   The visit ID of the patient. An integer. e.g. 1 means first visit
