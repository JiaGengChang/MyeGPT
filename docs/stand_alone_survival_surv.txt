Table name: `stand_alone_survival`
Description: Right-censored survival information of each patient (overall survival; OS, progression free survival; PFS) as well as various treatment lines and treatment responses (disease progression). PFS by treatment line is also available.
Format: column_number | field_name | description
# Identifier columns
1|public_id|Index column. Patient public identifier. MMRF_ followed by 4 unique digits. e.g. MMRF_1234
# Data columns related to right-censored progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). Preferred columns for PFS are (pfscdy, censpfs), for OS are (oscdy, censos). When PFS date is null, it is possible to impute using OS since death can be considered a progression event.
